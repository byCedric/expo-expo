Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## Expo CLI

Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. Expo CLI also has a web-based GUI that pops up in your web browser when you start your project — you can use the GUI instead of the command line interface if you're not yet comfortable using a terminal or prefer GUIs, both have similar capabilities.

### Requirements

- Node.js LTS release
- Git
- Watchman for macOS users

> Only Node.js LTS releases (even-numbered) are recommended. As Node.js [officially states](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), "Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases."

### Form examples

This is a select

<Select
  options={['Latest (v41.0.0)', 'v40.0.0']}
/>

### Example code snippet

This is random code.

```js title=TypeScript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';
import { Accelerometer } from 'expo-sensors';

// A comment about App
export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    z: 0,
  });

  const myRegex = /[a-z][A-Z]/g

  const _slow = () => {
    Accelerometer.setUpdateInterval(1000);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container} />
  );
});
```

This is some cool CSS.

```css title=CSS
.my-class {
  color: “papaya”;
}
```

### Installing Expo CLI

<!-- <Terminal
  cmd={['# Install the command line tools', '', '$ npm install --global expo-cli', '', '', '# Create a new project', '', '$ expo init my-project']}
  cmdCopy="npm install --global expo-cli"
/> -->

<!-- <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install --global expo-cli']} /> -->

<!-- <Terminal cmd={['# Install the command line tools', '', '$ npm install --global expo-cli']} /> -->

Verify that the installation was successful by running expo whoami. You're not logged in yet, so you will see "Not logged in". You can create an account by running expo register if you like, or if you have one already run expo login, but you also don't need an account to get started.

### Example tables

#### Component based

<Table
  headers={['Feature', 'Managed workflow', 'Bare workflow']}
  headersAlign={[null, undefined, TextAlign.Center]}
>
  <Row>
    <Cell>Develop apps with only JavaScript/TypeScript</Cell>
    <Cell><InfoIcon color="green" /></Cell>
    <Cell/>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <Cell>Use Expo build service to create your iOS and Android builds</Cell>
    <Cell><InfoIcon color="green" /></Cell>
    <Cell textAlign={TextAlign.Center}><InfoIcon color="green" /></Cell>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <Cell>Develop in Xcode and Android Studio</Cell>
    <Cell/>
    <Cell textAlign={TextAlign.Center}><InfoIcon color="green" /></Cell>
  </Row>
</Table>

#### Markdown based

| Feature | Managed workflow | Bare workflow |
